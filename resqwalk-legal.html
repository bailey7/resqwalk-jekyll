Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Application and other web sites you have visited.  Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  The Application’s third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including flash cookies), web beacons and other tracking technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  These third party cookies (including flash cookies), web beacons and other tracking technologies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.

Third party cookies (including flash cookies) and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of third party network advertisers.</p>

We maintain physical, electronic and managerial practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information. We limit and restrict access to Personal Information only to those employees who need it to carry out their business functions.
